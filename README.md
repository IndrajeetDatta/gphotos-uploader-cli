# Google photos uploader CLI

Command line tool to mass upload media folders to your google photos account(s).    

While the official tool is only supports Mac OS and Windows, this brings an uploader to Linux too.    

#### Features:

- specify folders to upload in config file
- optionally delete after upload
- upload to multiple google accounts
- security: logs you into google using OAuth (so this app doesn't have to know your password), and stores your temporary access code in your OS's secure storage (keyring/keychain).

# Quick start
##### Install using

```
go get -u github.com/nmrshll/gphotos-uploader-cli/cmd/gphotos-uploader-cli
```    

##### Create the config file with

```
gphotos-uploader-cli init
```

then modify it at `~/.config/gphotos-uploader-cli/config.hjson` to specify which folder you want to upload

([documentation](./.docs/configuration.md))  ([troubleshooting](./.docs/installation-troubleshooting.md))

##### Run it with 

```
gphotos-uploader-cli
```

- Go 1.11+ for installation using `go install github.com/nmrshll/gphotos-uploader-cli`
